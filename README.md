# Spring Annotation

Here is the list of all the spring annotation, which we have used:

  - @Component - Create a bean 
  - @Autowired - search for the object itself
  - @Configuration - spring configuration file
  - @primary - By default this bean will be configured
  - @qualifier - we can configure which bean to be passed
  - @bean - Make a object as a bean
  - @componentScan - Auto scan for component in package
